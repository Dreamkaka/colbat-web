from any supported service, in any format that you set in settings (+). yes, that includes mp3, which you all have been waiting for :D</p></li> <li><p>it’s now easier to switch between download modes (just a single toggle on the bottom).</p></li> <li><p>your youtube download format has been reset, sorry, but that was required to implement all audio downloads.</p></li> <li><p>default download format for youtube videos on all platforms is now webm. except for ios.</p></li> <li><p>cobalt now has emoji, just to spice up the black and white ui. all of them have been tuned to look the best in both themes. isn’t it cool?</p></li> <li><p>about, changelog, and donation popups have been merged into just one, for covnenience.</p></li> <li><p>changelog got a huge upgrade (as you can see), and now there are both major changes and latest commit info, just so commits can finally go back to being batshit insane.</p></li> <li><p>changelog popup appears on every major update, but you can disable it in settings, if you want to.</p></li> <li><p>changelog now opens by default when pressing ”?” button. i don’t think anyone reads “about” as often.</p></li> <li><p>settings (+) have been split into three tabs, also for convenience and ease of use.</p></li> <li><p>added support for donation links. you can now donate through boosty, not only via crypto :D</p></li> <li><p>donate popup has been rearranged and tuned just a tiny bit.</p></li> <li><p>you can now click away from any popup by pressing the void behind it.</p></li> <li><p>you can also press “escape” key on keyboard to close any popup.</p></li> <li><p>switchers and buttons are now way easier on eye. white border is gone from where it’s unneeded.</p></li> <li><p>buttons are now very satisfying to press.</p></li>
